Social Distancing Algorithm
Social Distancing is a method that used to control epidemic diseases. For COVID-19, we are using social distancing to protect us.
This algorithm calculates distances between people and draw different colors of bounding boxes for three risk degree. 
When this project were created, this references above used. Used SSD-MobileNet model for object detection. 
For better detection for bad visibility areas, i added CLAHE preprocessing method. 

I am improving this algorithm for better detection and better distance measurement.
